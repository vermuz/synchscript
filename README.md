MySQL Database Replication
==========================
Script to institute master/slave replication between two MySQL servers

MySQL replication allows you to have an exact copy of a database from a master server on another server (slave), and  
updates to the database on the master server are immediately replicated to the database on the slave server 
so that both databases are in sync.
